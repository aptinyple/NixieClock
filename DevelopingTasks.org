Steps of Nixie Clock creation

* TODO Develop the concept of the clock [0/2]:
  - [ ] Define basic functions of the clock
  - [ ] Create design concept (shape, indicators placement, etc.)

* TODO Make the clock design:
** TODO Make schematic using  gEDA gschem [0/3]:
   - [ ] Learn how to use gEDA gschem
   - [ ] Make and/or find all needed electronic components symbols
   - [ ] Make schematic of all blocks [0/3]:
     - [ ] Power supply
     - [ ] Nixie tube control block
     - [ ] Main control block
** TODO Make PCB using gEDA PCB [0/3]
   - [ ] Learn how to use gEDA PCB
   - [ ] Make and/or find all needed electronic components sitting places
   - [ ] Make PCB of all blocks [0/3]:
     - [ ] Power supply
     - [ ] Nixie tube control block
     - [ ] Main control block
** TODO Develop source code for microcontroller [0/2]
   - [ ] Create base-functional code
   - [ ] Add additional functions
** TODO Make clock design scheme [0/2]:
   - [ ] Make front panel scheme
   - [ ] Make the rest of the clock case scheme.

* TODO Buy all components

* TODO Create the clock [0/3]:
  - [ ] Create PCBs
  - [ ] Solder all components
  - [ ] Assemble the clock
